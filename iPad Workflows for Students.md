## Annotate PDF lecture notes (file comes from Canvas app)

**Tools**: Canvas --> Box

* You can annotate PDFs directly in the Canvas app
* Then, use the share sheet to save to Box (you'd need to set up your Box app first)

---

## Annotate PDF lecture notes (file comes from other apps)

**Tools**: (App) --> Box --> iAnnotate

* Use the share sheet to save to Box
* Then, open the document in iAnnotate to, well, annotation. Changes are saved and uploaded upon closing the document (or, hold the "x" icon)

## Take handwritten notes

**Tools**: GoodNotes (--> Box)

* This is my current go-to because:
  * It let me keep my notes in "notebooks"
  * I can use/import templates, including Cornell Notes
  * I can search my handwriting


---

## Take electronic notes

**Tools**: OneNote --> Office 365/BuckeyeMail

* This is a great, free, organized solution
* I don't use it for handwritten notes because writing with the Apple Pencil feels off
* You can insert media, files, links, etc:
  * ... in the app (the camera tool is also a document scanner)
  * ... using the share sheet

---

## Take electronic notes (cont.)

* OneNote is a great tool for, for example, online research 
  * If you are doing a tradition paper research, you might look into something like Papership, Mendeley, EndNote, etc.
