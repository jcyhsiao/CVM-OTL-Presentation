* Be curious about new apps, but use what works for you
* You can chain apps together to create powerful workflows

## Keep yourself up-to-date with your courses

**Tool**: Canvas *(it's what the system is called)*

* Access courses
* Tweak your notification settings
* Check upcoming events, due dates, etc.
* Check notifications and messages
* Access course materials and activities

---

## Annotate PDF files (file comes from Canvas app)

**Tools**: Canvas --> Box

* You can annotate PDFs directly in the Canvas app
* Then, use the share sheet to save to Box (you'd need to set up your Box app first)

---

## Annotate PDF files (file comes from other apps)

**Tools**: *App* --> Box --> iAnnotate

* Use the share sheet to save to Box
* Then, open the document in iAnnotate to, well, annotation. Changes are saved and uploaded upon closing the document (or, hold the "x" icon)

---

## Annotate/edit Office documents

**Tools**: *App* --> Box --> Office (Word / Excel / PowerPoint / etc.)

* Use the share sheet to save to Box
* Open document in Box
* Then, you can open document in Word; changes are saved back to Box (we recommend that you set up your Office apps first)

---

## Submit an file upload assignment to Carmen

**Tools**: (Canvas -->) *App* --> Canvas

* Remember: you can annotate PDF directly in the Canvas app
* From the app with which you are working on/storing your submission:
  * Use the share sheet to "Copy to Canvas"
  * Open the assignment in Canvas
  * Under Submission > Turn In, find your submission
  * Lastly, remember to submit!

---

## Take handwritten notes

**Tools**: GoodNotes (--> Box)

* This is my current go-to because:
  * It let me keep my notes in "notebooks"
  * I can use/import templates, including Cornell Notes
  * I can search my handwriting

Bonus: If you would like to keep everything in GoodNotes, you can also import your PDF into a GoodNotes notebook.

---

## Take electronic notes

**Tools**: OneNote --> Office 365/BuckeyeMail

* This is a great, free, organized solution
* I don't personally use it for handwritten notes because writing with the Apple Pencil feels off
* You can insert media, files, links, etc:
  * ... in the app (the camera tool is also a document scanner)
  * ... using the share sheet

---

## Take electronic notes (cont.)

* OneNote is a great tool for, for example, online research 
  * If you are doing a tradition paper research, you might look into something like Papership, Mendeley, EndNote, etc.

<!--
## Take a quiz/exam in Carmen

**Tool**: Canvas

* You can take the majority of quizzes in the Canvas app
* If a quiz is not compatible with the app, it will prompt you to take it using a browser
* **Before you start a quiz, make sure that you have reliable internet connection**
  * You can resume an unsubmitted attempt as long as time isn't up
  * The app will prompt you if you try to submit without answering all questions

## Before we move on ... some tips for Carmen assignments and quizzes

*We know what you did or didn't do ... hint hint, nudge nudge*

* Double-check if you actually submitted your an assignment, quiz, or discussion comment!
  * You can also confirm this on the Grades page
* You can resume an unsubmitted quiz attempt as as long as time isn't up. Carmen will ask you to confirm if you try to submit with unanswered questions.
* Unless you know what you're doing, don't completely turn off emails from Carmen. You might something important!
